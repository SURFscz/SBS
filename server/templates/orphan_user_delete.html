        <p>We noticed an account was created in the SURF Research Access Management service. But we haven't noticed any
            follow up activity that signals us the account is necessary. In order to protect your privacy and make sure
            we don't store personal information we don't need, we have deleted the account. If you think we shouldn't
            have done this, please let us know by sending an email to sram-support@surf.nl .
