        <p>We noticed you created a profile in the SURF Research Access Management service. But it seems like you
            are not using it. To protect your privacy we do not want to store personal information we don't need,
            and we have deleted the profile. If you still need to use SURF Research Access Management, simply login
            again.
            If you think we shouldn't have done this, please let us know on sram-support@surf.nl.
