            For testing purposes there is mock implementation of a remote SCIM client in SRAM. If a <span

            All POST (new memberships) and PUT (update memberships) messages are stored in memory. To test the SCIM
            functionality configure one of more
            services with the mock SCIM endpoint and start making changes to collaborations and groups that are
            connected to one
